julia - add a pop of red or other kind of contrast, really likes font + character idea
coen - nailed colours and aesth. be careful not to centralise queerness (beware the queer pit!) queer not as front and center
poppy - denim good. rough but sweet rebel
elyssa - likes little sketch doodles
marianna - smoky vague aesthetic MORE COLOUR pop art- NOT trad neopolitan. as contemporary as possible!!! dua lipa cleaner shinier and lighter. still classy tho. fashionable- vogue italy. get rid of that shield. likes pink and red
kal - daisy aren stagename (possibly). makeshift astronaut. more abstract colourful galactic album art
josephine - unexpected. not digging the brights. more mysterious. emphasize growth and freedom. needs indication of darkness. take inspiration from florence & the machine. moodier. change colours asap. artist name: josie noble
hollie - doesn't dislike the font- good for title/name not body text- maybe use for logo? too edgy/harsh- softer maybe floral/ornamental. doesn't resonate with tattoo photos. cabin image as back cover possibly. HOLY stagename
cain - sorry i forgot to write anything
brendan - colouring in lol. nailed the vibe
